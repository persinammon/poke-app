# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

`npm run eject` was run to give full control of build tools, and then
Webpack was installed to handle bundling of `.scss`, `.css`, and `.js` files.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Originally builds and bundles using `react-scripts`. 
Decided to change to `webpack` configured for JavaScript, CSS, and Sass for learning experience.
