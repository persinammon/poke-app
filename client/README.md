# Frontend React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

`npm run eject` was run to give full control of build tools, and then
Webpack was installed to handle bundling of `.scss`, `.css`, and `.js` files.

Use `npm run build` for latest bundling and build.

Use `npm run start` to start app in development mode, running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
