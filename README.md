# Pokémon Social App

This web application allows users to sign up, create teams, and collaboratively
create team rosters.

### Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express.js
- React.js
- MongoDB
- Socket.io
- Chakra-UI
- Webpack to bundle assets
- [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
- Common middleware associated with Express.js (found in `server/package.json`)


### API

Full documentation of API and data models are in a Swagger Doc generated by [Swagger](editor.swagger.io).
They can be accessed by running the Express.js server and navigating to `http://localhost:8000/api-docs/`.

### Running Locally in Docker

To start the services:

```
docker compose up -d
```

To end the services and clean up containers:

```
docker compose down
```

### Local Development Setup

1. Install Node.js on computer and clone directory. Check installation:

```
node --version
```

2. Install packages using `npm`. 

```
cd server
npm i 
cd ../client
npm i 
```

For development, a cloud MongoDB database was used, requiring developer credentials.
PokéAPI has no required credentials or rate limiting.
For deployment, switch to containerized MongoDB db instance.

3. Run using `node` or `nodemon`. `nodemon` allows for hot deployment, or automatic server restart on code changes.
Both are included in the `npm` scripts defined in `package.json`.

Deployment:
```
npm start
```

Hot deployment:
```
npm run devstart
```

4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` to interact with web application UI.

5. Use `curl` to test endpoints. Examples:

```
curl -d @test/testcase.json -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8000
curl -v http://localhost:8000
curl -v http://localhost:3000
```
