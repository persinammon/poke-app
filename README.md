### Running Locally in Docker

To start the services:

```
docker compose up -d
```

To end the services and clean up containers:

```
docker compose down
```

### Local Development Setup

1. Install Node.js on computer and clone directory. Check installation:

```
node --version
```

2. Install packages using `npm`. `nodemon` only works with a global install. 

```
cd server
npm i 
cd ../client
npm i 
npm i -g nodemon
```

For development, a cloud MongoDB database was used, requiring developer credentials.
PokéAPI has no required credentials or rate limiting.
For deployment, working on switching to containerized MongoDB db instance.

3. Run using `node` or `nodemon`. `nodemon` allows for hot deployment, or automatic server restart on code changes.

```
nodemon server.js
```

4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` to interact with web application UI.

5. Use `curl` to test endpoints. Examples:

```
curl -d @test/testcase.json -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8000
curl -v http://localhost:8000
curl -v http://localhost:3000
```
